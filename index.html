                        <p>
                            I am 23 and have had a passion for creating any and everything since I was a child. I have been been coding for years and have experience with a variety of technologies including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In the past I have created code for robots, websites, and even some games. I am always looking for new projects to work on and am excited to see what the future holds.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Besides coding, I am also very artistic; I have always wanted to get into graphic design.
                            I draw and paint in my free time and have even created some digital art used in logos and on clothing.
